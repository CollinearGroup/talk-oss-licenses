### Why Open Source?

According to...

* Developers: Â¡free code!
* Google: Customers want options
* Dgraph: Adoption of new tech
* MediaWiki: Genuine humanitarians
* Collinear Group: To give back and showcase

Note:

I can't get into all the details here. It's simply interesting to note how others have approached this, so that you can frame what your involvement is going to look like.

### Open Source Life-cycle

1. Grass-roots movement
2. Project Management <- Us.
3. Enterprise Management
3. Adoption

Note:

There is a lot of risk in the first two phases, so tread wisely.
In step 3 and 4, the lawyers and leaders have typically done the hard part for you. Unless you're a roll indie.

Note:

Our OSS Strategy has to deal with all these licenses.

### Recommendation

* Apache 2.0
* If not, consider a Contributor License Agreement
* If you like controversy: [Commons Clause](https://commonsclause.com/)

Note:

* CLA - Ensures that the repo maintainer gets the rights over contributions.
* Commons Clause - prohibts turning around and selling software like AWS did with Redis.
* Google banned the GPL and CC'd licenses.
